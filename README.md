Cloud Foundry UAA Terraform Provider
================================

Overview
--------

This Terraform provider plugin allows you to configure a Cloud Foundry [User Account and Authentication](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa) (UAA) service declaratively using [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl).

## Installations

**Requirements:** You need, of course, terraform (**>=0.13**) which is available here: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Add to your terraform file:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cfsecurity = {
      source  = "orange-cloudfoundry/uaa"
      version = "latest"
    }
  }
}
```

## Documentation

You can find documentation at https://registry.terraform.io/providers/orange-cloudfoundry/uaa/latest/docs


Developing the Provider
-----------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.8+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Clone this repository to `GOPATH/src/github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/terraform-provider-uaa` as its packaging structure has been defined such that it will be compatible with the Terraform provider plugin framwork in 0.10.x.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-uaa
...
```

Testing the Provider
--------------------

To test the provider you will need to run a local PCF Dev instance or launch it in AWS via the `scripts/pcfdev-up.sh`. Once the instance is running you will need to export the following environment variables.

```
export UAA_LOGIN_URL=https://login.local.pcfdev.io
export UAA_AUTH_URL=https://uaa.local.pcfdev.io
export UAA_CLIENT_ID=admin
export UAA_CLIENT_SECRET=admin-client-secret
export UAA_SKIP_SSL_VALIDATION=true
```

You can export the following environment variables to enable detail debug logs.

```
export UAA_DEBUG=true
export UAA_TRACE=debug.log
```

In order to run the tests locally, run.

```
cd uaa
TF_ACC=1 go test -v -timeout 120m .
```

To run the tests in AWS first launch PCFDev in AWS via `scripts/pcfdev-up.sh`, and then run.

```
make testacc
```

> > Acceptance tests are run against a PCF Dev instance in AWS before a release is created. Any other testing should be done using a local PCF Dev instance.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
